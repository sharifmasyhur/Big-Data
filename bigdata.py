# 'requests' is used to make HTTP requests (accessing the URL)
# 'json' is used to pretty-print JSON data (optional, but very useful)

# "contains a list of all routes... along with the latest statistics."
# This seems to be the most interesting and dynamic dataset.

# This is good practice in case your internet connection drops
# or the server is temporarily unavailable.
try:
    # Send a GET request to the API URL
    response = requests.get(API_URL)

    # Check if the request was successful (status code 200 means 'OK').
    # If there‚Äôs an error (like 404 Not Found), this will raise an exception.

    # Convert the response from JSON (text) into a Python object (list/dictionary)
    data = response.json()
